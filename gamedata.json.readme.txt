	mojoname:	Defines install dir and uninstall script name. Defaults to simplified, titled HB name [mojo]
			gamename_with_underscores -> Gamename

	steamid:	Steam AppID of the game [steam]
	basename:	A "game ID" name that defines install dir, icon name and other settings [custom]
			Similar in usage to mojoname, defaults to a simplified HB name

Additional info on some games
-----------------------------

adobeair
	There's also 2 .deb files available, one from Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 partner repository, which is
	expected to go End of Life and shut down on April 2015, the other from Adobe itself.
	Both install fine in Ubuntu Precise 12.04 64-bit, but both fail to succeed installing games.
	So currently the configured install method uses the .bin installer from Adobe.
	It requires custom install script, a GUI, and it's not fully unattended, but version is exactly
	the same (1:2.6.0.19170). It also registers itself in dpkg as an installed package

amnesia
	Also available in USC apt-get as 'amnesia' package, but not from any particular bundle list

anomalywarzoneearth_pc
	Package 'anomaly' exists in USC, but is not available in HiB Android 3 USC list anymore

bastion
bastion_bundle
	Same game, but "bastion" from HiB 5 is in USC as 'bastion' package,
	"bastion_bundle" is from from HiB 9, which has no USC list.

brokenswordshadowofthetemplars
	Also available in HiB Android 6 USC list, but not in HiB Android 7.
	Package 'broken-sword-directors-cut'

fieldrunners_android_pc_soundtrack
	USC apt-get only available for HiB Android 3. For HiB Android 10 use 'deb' method

gianasisters_twisteddreams
	Not available for Linux or Mac

limbo
limbo_bundle
	Crossover version in USC as 'limbo'.
	Recently got native version in both HB (mojo installer 'limbo') and SteamOS

mcpixel_android_pc
	3 download choices, all have pros and cons:
	'32 bit .deb': .deb inside a .zip. Package 'gd.sos.mcpixel', predepends on 'adobeair'.
		The .swf inside is not standalone, so it requires Adobe AIR anyway.
	'Air': .air installer inside a .zip. Obviously requires Adobe AIR to run
	'.tar.gz': standalone .swf inside. The only that runs on Flash and does not require AIR. But zip has no icons.


The following games are in SteamOS but are also available in USC.
